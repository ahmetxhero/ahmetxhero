# Projects Directory

This directory contains all the individual projects that were previously organized under the "oynaxo" repository.

## Project Structure

Each project should have its own subdirectory with:
- README.md (project-specific documentation)
- Source code files
- Configuration files
- Dependencies (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)

## Adding New Projects

When adding a new project:
1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Add a README.md file explaining the project
3. Include all necessary source files
4. Update this README if needed

## Current Projects
